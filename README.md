# RSA / CRT comparison on a SMS App
This project compares both the encryption and decryption times of the RSA and RSA-CRT methods on SMS messages between two users to determine which algorithm is the most efficient for a simple SMS application using Python.

## How to run this project:
### Encryption comparison:
1. Open up two terminals (or a divided terminal)
2. Execute the file on your first terminal (`python encryption-comparison.py`)
3. Since it is the first file, select '1' as your option (host)
4. On your second terminal, run the same file the same way as before and select '2' as an option
5. you have now established a connection between your two clients, chat away!

 *__note:__ Once you start typing any messages and sending them, you will see the time it takes to encrypt the messages displayed on the screen.*

### Decryption comparison:
1. Open up two terminals (or a divided terminal)
2. Execute the file on your first terminal (`python decryption-comparison.py`)
3. Since it is the first file, select '1' as your option (host)
4. On your second terminal, run the same file the same way as before and select '2' as an option
5. you have now established a connection between your two clients, chat away!

*__note:__ Once you start typing any messages and sending them, you will see the time it takes to decrypt the messages displayed on the screen.*

Once you're done chatting, type 'exit' on both terminals to finish the programs.
